# CTA_Project
Understanding access to CTA using Chicago Community Area socioeconomic and demographic informatio.n

We are trying to identify the factors that most influence access to public transportation within the the City of Chicago. To try to see which variables contribute the most to access to public transportation. In hopes of identifying potential improvements in CTA distribution throughout the city to ensure those most reliant on CTA are having there needs met.

The data we obtained to conduct this analysis was Chicago Transit Authority bus and train stop information and Chicago Community Area locations retrieved through the City of Chicago data portal. Information from the American Community Survery 2016-2020 obtained from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. As well as wikipedia data with the sizes of the community areas within the city of Chicago.

To do this we built a linear regression and decision tree model to explain the importance of the features within the model to predict access to public transportation quantified by creating a target variables of stop Density per square mile.
